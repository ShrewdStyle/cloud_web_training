# cloud_web_training
Cloud Web Training Project created with HTML and SASS

Here I was able to focus on a single page website using HTML and SASS before moving onto the React framework, I was able to focus more on my animations when creating this website and will be able to compare this method to the React design.

Cloud Web Training was designed as cloud computing is something which i really enjoy to dive into, there are extremely big technologies in the cloud and the usage can really accelerate a companies growth. There are always new features being added and you will always learn something when seeing how the cloud can be used.
